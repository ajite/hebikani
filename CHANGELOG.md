### Feature

* feat: add double check feature. It allows you to set a wrong answer t… (#39)

It is useful when you used a synonym that was not in the word list. ([`ad7dc9b`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/ad7dc9bfe645319496fa1df3faceac7283ea8f27))

* feat: improve reviews queue management (#37)

It avoid the same question to be asked twice in a row. It makes it easier.

Keeping a queue of 10 itwms (max 20 questions or less with radicals), makes it easier to interrupt a session. ([`e127f30`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/e127f30883898b1a4f52594592be19434545350f))

## v1.2.0 (2022-06-01)

### Feature

* feat: Vertical histogram to display next reviews (#11)

- &#34;summary&#34; displays a vertical histogram of the daily review plan.
- Add test for the histogram and the summary output
- When no next reviews for the day are available display: &#34;No more reviews for today&#34;
- Made a new demo.gif with the new summary output
- Add python freezegun to help testing the histogram (mock date) ([`67fc8a8`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/67fc8a846ab34ec478c7937a69d8401720839792))

### Refactor

* refactor: change variable named katana to katakana (#10) ([`3fc723f`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/3fc723ffd0ae156c02cc978e884a04b8b13db9ab))


## v1.1.0 (2022-05-31)

### Documentation

* docs: change the doc title name doc to HebiKani (#8) ([`0435831`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/0435831d22c721c85669d0539b9d2ac2f8d830b4))

### Feature

* feat: hard mode requires correct kana (#9)

In hard mode when a question has a reading in katakana:
do not accept its hiragana alternative.

E.g: ベッドの下 answer should be ベッドのした and not べっどのした.

In normal mode both  ベッドのした and べっどのした will work. ([`3b0b834`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/3b0b8347d8d1ef1d9dd6636b61a295d560b1dae1))


## v1.0.0 (2022-05-30)

### Ci

* ci: use relekang/python-semantic-release action (#5)

The previous action could not upload a release to pypi. ([`951fc4e`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/951fc4e0211f3de712471e2a5eabe507d60cafab))

* ci: typo in quality badge branch condition (#3)

It was looking for a branch named master instead of main ([`41798fb`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/41798fb8ee356f3a99a5a82b504ef4e3b252dc6d))

* ci: setup semantic-release (#2)

Improve github actions workflows

- do quality check
- then create badge and publish on pypi and github

All the changes on the main branch need to come from PR ([`e3ccb15`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/e3ccb1530d4c9915c6766b060664994b21a61930))

### Documentation

### Fix

* fix: hard mode does not work with inexact answers (#4)

Answers are considered inexact in hard mode when:

1) For a question with 1 acceptable answer:
- Used an unacceptable answer (E.g: onyumi instead of kunyomi)

2) For a question with 2 or more acceptable answer:
- Used the correct number of answers
- One or all of them are unacceptable answers.

* ci: flake8 is taking too long to run

- Ignore .venv and build directory
 - add semantic workflow to check semantic title (will be working for future PR) ([`20df7ca`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/20df7caa96d6f1f01f8a49054be51c9d14d51592))

### Refactor

* refactor: renamed project from WaniKani CLI to HebiKani (#7)

You will need to import from hebikani instead of wanikani_cli

BREAKING CHANGE: the library name on PIP is not wanikani-cli anymore. ([`f9a8ebd`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/f9a8ebda6c11d772676c1a2edfd711fd83e6ba9d))

### Style

### Test

* test: github action fails due to PyGObject

Change the testing OS to macos-latest since it does not requires extra ([`2554fb0`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/2554fb06e4d7476f04f955fd278d0e602a24df1d))

### Unknown

The doc was not building properly. Add a requirements.txt in doc.
Contains only doc dependency. ([`c935484`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/c93548432057fc56735d2057506e3ebc12434ec1))

* fix typo on badge name in README.rst ([`9666796`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/96667960cd1f8de21069be5559ee35452a61aee3))

* Add coverage badge through gist and shield.io

Improve github actions to cache poetry install (unless it need new lib) ([`db64777`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/db64777cc154843aa8866fb84b2db2493ccb318d))

* Change http_get, post and put to one method

Updated test coverage ([`cf8c6e7`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/cf8c6e7ed19c84ac245e3bb81b06e59ef0816682))

* Colorized lessons mnemonics as well ([`b38d04e`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/b38d04e5440da5af3743af0688fe0580354b33a1))

* Replaced WaniKani tags by color in mnemonics. ([`b6e6e31`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/b6e6e310aa6000ffbcd080ac8548bd230f561c0e))

* Improve lesson layout. Pressing enter goes right.

Improve display layout when doing lessons.

* Clear the audio cache when the program ends.

It was working only when the user used ctrl + c ([`bb50ddf`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/bb50ddfdcc6893633aa34aadd962801b4f017f1d))

* Cache audio during and play it in a thread.

It is useless to download X times the same audio.
We cache it during our first download.

It will change the alternate method a little bit
since caching keeps the same audio gender.

Audio are download at the begining of a
lessons (with extra character).

Audio are played in a different thread. ([`6c174e9`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/6c174e91ba8844a91f7d0e1e3d8b97a53baf49a1))

* Display number of readings in hard mode.

Some kanji have 2 readings while their vocab has only one.
e.g.: 谷. The readings for the kanji are: たに、や.
But the vocabulary only needs one answer: たに.

It feels fairer that way. ([`67bed6c`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/67bed6c7340821b03d5b7038964eca30401bea4a))

* Fix forgot to rename _subject_per_ids in test ([`5e89e6f`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/5e89e6ff8365a6f3f1452cc6f7f3861a83789683))

* Send reviews back to WaniKani API.

Added a --dry-run for testing purposes.
This mode does not send anything back to the API.

Added a hard mode that will require the user to input
all the prounonciation of a given kanji.
E.g: なに,なん for 何. The order does not matter.

Changed the entire architecture to handle subject.
Removed Kanji, Vocabulary and Radical class.

Create a class to handle Subject update. ([`c85abac`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/c85abac1059c2194cf976204f77fbaf0ccff42bc))

* Add a an answer manager object to solve questions

Check for four different types of answers
(Correct, Incorrect, Inexact, A bit off):
- Correct answer (right)
- Incorrect answer (wrong)
- Inexact applies only for reading. When using an non acceptable answer.
  E.g kunyomi instead of onyomi. Inexact methods are calculated through
  python difflib library. We set a constant ratio to 0.8.
- A bit off applies only for meaning. E.g: skillfull instead of skillful

When an answer is inexact we ask the user for the exact meaning.
When an answer is bit off we ask the user to validate his answer.

Moved enums in a file named typing.py ([`7b431f1`](https://github.com/ajite/hebikani/commit/7b431f1863a237078a50108705768b9c832d728a))

* Feature display ASCII art for non UTF character.

We download the smallest PNG the API offers (32x32)
